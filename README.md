# Airr-Quotes-to-Obsidian-Link-Formatting
- This script takes Airr Quotes and converts them to Markdown formatting to be used in note taking apps like Obsidian. 
- The link formatting converts the Airr quotes from: 
  - [(45 second AirrQuote)](https://www.airr.io/quote/60a4527cd0a8838a7581213e) Money is the bubble that never pops
  - to:
  - [Money is the bubble that never pops](https://www.airr.io/quote/60a4527cd0a8838a7581213e)
  
 - Copy your Airr quotes and paste them in a .txt file and paste the path of that file into the console when prompted.
 - The .txt. file will be overwritten with the correct format in bulleted form.
